# Dockerfiles

I have already been using docker for three years, and I found that I need to do some customize work for my use case. So I decided to make a repo which contains all my personal customize `dockerfiles`. 

## archlinux2cpp

This is the dockerfile for C/C++ developers who use the `VScode remote development extension`. It contains some useful tools such as `llvm toolchains`, `cmake`, `vcpkg` and so on.

Originally, I decided to make it because of the need for `the VScode remote development extension`, and it will be support for JetBrains' upcoming remote development plugins in 2019.3 predictably.
